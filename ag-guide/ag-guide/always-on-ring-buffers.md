# AlwaysOn Ring Buffers
  Some diagnostic AlwaysOn information can be obtained from the SQL Server ring buffers, or the sys.dm_os_ring_buffers dynamic management view (DMV). The ring buffers are created during SQL Server startup, and record alerts within the SQL Server system for internal diagnostics. They are not supported, but you can still extract valuable information from them when troubleshooting issues. These ring buffers provide another source of diagnostics when SQL Server hangs or has crashed.  
  
 The following Transact-SQL (T-SQL) query retrieves all event records from the AlwaysOn ring buffers.  
  
```tsql  
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_os_ring_buffers WHERE ring_buffer_type LIKE '%HADR%'  
```  
  
 To make the data more manageable, filter the data by date and the ring buffer type. The following query retrieves records from the specified ring buffer that occurred today.  
  
```tsql  
DECLARE @runtime datetime  
SET @runtime = GETDATE()  
SELECT CONVERT (varchar(30), @runtime, 121) as data_collection_runtime,   
DATEADD (ms, -1 * (inf.ms_ticks - ring.[timestamp]), GETDATE()) AS ring_buffer_record_time,   
ring.[timestamp] AS record_timestamp, inf.ms_ticks AS cur_timestamp, ring.*   
FROM sys.dm_os_ring_buffers ring  
CROSS JOIN sys.dm_os_sys_info inf where ring_buffer_type='<RING_BUFFER_TYPE>'  
```  
  
 The Record column in each record contains diagnostic data in XML format. The XML data differs between the ring buffer types. For more information on each ring buffer type, see [AlwaysOn Ring Buffer Types](../ag-guide/always-on-ring-buffers.md#BKMK_RingBufferTypes). To make the XML data more readable, you need to customize your T-SQL query to extract the desired XML elements. For example, the following query retrieves all events from the RING_BUFFER_HADRDBMGR_API ring buffer and formats the XML data into separate table columns.  
  
```tsql  
WITH hadr(ts, type, record) AS  
(  
  SELECT timestamp AS ts, ring_buffer_type AS type, CAST(record AS XML) AS record   
  FROM sys.dm_os_ring_buffers WHERE ring_buffer_type = 'RING_BUFFER_HADRDBMGR_API'  
)  
SELECT   
  ts,  
  type,  
  record.value('(./Record/@id)[1]','bigint') AS [Record ID],  
  record.value('(./Record/@time)[1]','bigint') AS [Time],  
  record.value('(./Record/HadrDbMgrAPI/dbId)[1]', 'bigint') AS [DBID],  
  record.value('(/Record/HadrDbMgrAPI/API)[1]', 'varchar(50)') AS [API],  
  record.value('(/Record/HadrDbMgrAPI/Action)[1]', 'varchar(50)') AS [Action],  
  record.value('(/Record/HadrDbMgrAPI/role)[1]', 'int') AS [Role],  
  record.value('(/Record/Stack)[1]', 'varchar(100)') AS [Call Stack]  
FROM hadr  
ORDER BY record.value('(./Record/@time)[1]','bigint') DESC  
GO  
```  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_RingBufferTypes"></a> AlwaysOn Ring Buffer Types  
 There are 4 AlwaysOn ring buffers in sys.dm_os_ring_buffers. The table below describes the ring buffer types and a sample of the content of the Record column for each ring buffer type.  
  
 **RING_BUFFER_HADRDBMGR_API**  
  
 Records state transitions that have taken place or are taking place. When looking at the state transitions pay close attention to the objectType values.  
  
```xml  
<Record id="11" type="RING_BUFFER_HADRDBMGR_STATE" time="860243">  
  <HadrDbMgrState>  
    <objectType>HadrUsers</objectType>  
    <currentState>HDbMState_Starting</currentState>  
    <proposedState>HDbMState_Started</proposedState>  
    <targetState>HDbMState_Started</targetState>  
    <legalTransition>Y</legalTransition>  
    <role>1</role>  
  </HadrDbMgrState>  
</Record>  
```  
  
 **RING_BUFFER_HADRDBMGR_STATE**  
  
 Records internal method or function calls made by AlwaysOn activity. It can show information such as suspend, resume, or role changes, including both the entry and exit points.  
  
```xml  
<Record id="45" type="RING_BUFFER_HADRDBMGR_STATE" time="1723487912">  
  <HadrDbMgrState>  
    <dbId>5</dbId>  
    <objectType>HadrDbMgr</objectType>  
    <currentState>HDbMState_Starting</currentState>  
    <proposedState>HDbMState_Started</proposedState>  
    <targetState>HDbMState_Started</targetState>  
    <legalTransition>Y</legalTransition>  
    <role>2</role>  
  </HadrDbMgrState>  
</Record>  
```  
  
 **RING_BUFFER_HADRDBMGR_COMMIT**  
  
```xml  
<Record id="0" type="RING_BUFFER_HADRDBMGR_COMMIT" time="1723475368">  
  <HadrDbMgrCommitPolicy>  
    <dbId>5</dbId>  
    <replicaId>883a18f5-97d5-450f-8f8f-9983a4fa5299</replicaId>  
    <dbHardenPolicy>KillAll</dbHardenPolicy>  
    <dbSyncConfig>0x0</dbSyncConfig>  
    <syncPartnerCount>0</syncPartnerCount>  
    <minSyncPartnerConfig>0</minSyncPartnerConfig>  
    <partnerHardenPolicy>KillAll</partnerHardenPolicy>  
    <partnerSyncConfig>0x0</partnerSyncConfig>  
    <logBlock>0x0000000000000000</logBlock>  
    <leaseExpired>Y</leaseExpired>  
    <partnerChange>N</partnerChange>  
    <role>2</role>  
  </HadrDbMgrCommitPolicy>  
</Record>  
```  
  
 **RING_BUFFER_HADR_TRANSPORT_STATE**  
  
```xml  
<Record id="3" type="RING_BUFFER_HADR_TRANSPORT_STATE" time="1723485399">  
  <HadrTransportState>  
    <agId>08264B79-D10B-412F-B38D-CA07B08E9BD8</agId>  
    <localArId>883A18F5-97D5-450F-8F8F-9983A4FA5299</localArId>  
    <targetArId>628D6349-72DD-4D18-A6E1-1272645660BA</targetArId>  
    <currentState>HadrSession_Configuring</currentState>  
    <targetState>HadrSession_Connected</targetState>  
    <legalTransition>Y</legalTransition>  
  </HadrTransportState>  
</Record>  
```  
  
## Parse XML Data from a Ring Buffer  
 You can parse the Record field from the ring buffer you are inspecting by using [value&#40;&#41; Method &#40;xml Data Type&#41;](../Topic/value()%20Method%20(xml%20Data%20Type).md) in your query. To use this method, you first need to [CAST](../Topic/CAST%20and%20CONVERT%20(Transact-SQL).md) the record column in the ring buffer into XML. For example, the query below demonstrates how to parse RING_BUFFER_HADRDBMGR_API into readable format using this method.  
  
```  
WITH hadr(ts, type, record) AS  
   (SELECT timestamp AS ts, ring_buffer_type AS type, CAST(record AS XML) AS record   
FROM sys.dm_os_ring_buffers   
WHERE ring_buffer_type = 'RING_BUFFER_HADRDBMGR_API')  
SELECT ts,  
type,  
record.value('(./Record/@id)[1]','bigint') AS [Record id],  
record.value('(./Record/@time)[1]','bigint') AS [Time],  
record.value('(./Record/HadrDbMgrAPI/dbId)[1]', 'bigint') AS [dbid],  
record.value('(/Record/HadrDbMgrAPI/API)[1]', 'varchar(50)') AS [API],  
record.value('(/Record/HadrDbMgrAPI/Action)[1]', 'varchar(50)') AS [Action],  
record.value('(/Record/HadrDbMgrAPI/role)[1]', 'int') AS [Role],  
record.value('(/Record/Stack)[1]', 'varchar(100)') AS [Call Stack]  
FROM hadr  
ORDER BY record.value('(./Record/@time)[1]','bigint') DESC  
GO  
```
